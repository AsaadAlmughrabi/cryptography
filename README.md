# Vigenère Cipher Implementation

This Python script demonstrates encryption and decryption using the Vigenère cipher.

## Usage

1. Replace `original_string` with the text you want to encrypt.
2. Set `encryption_key` to the key you want to use for encryption.
3. Run the script to see the original, encrypted, and decrypted strings.

## Example

For example, encrypting "Hello, World!" with key "SECRET" results in:
- Encrypted: "Tfdut, Ovzru!"

Decryption of the encrypted string "Tfdut, Ovzru!" with the same key "SECRET" gives back the original string "Hello, World!".
