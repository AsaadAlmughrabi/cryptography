# Caesar Cipher Implementation in Python

This Python script demonstrates encryption and decryption using the Caesar cipher.

## Overview

The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Usage

1. Replace `original_string` with the text you want to encrypt.
2. Set `encryption_key` to the key you want to use for encryption.
3. Run the script to see the original, encrypted, and decrypted strings.

## Example

For example, encrypting "Hello, World!" with key 3 results in:
- Encrypted: "Khoor, Zruog!"

Decryption of the encrypted string "Khoor, Zruog!" with the same key 3 gives back the original string "Hello, World!".
